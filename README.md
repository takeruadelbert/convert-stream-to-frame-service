# Convert Stream to Frame Service

# Without Poetry
First thing first, before running the application, we need to install necessary dependencies 
by running this command below:

```
sudo chmod +x install-package.sh
sudo chmod +x ood-run.sh 
```

and then we install them by running:

```
./install-package.sh
```

Finally, we can run the app by running:

```
./ood-run.sh
```

# With Poetry
Install required dependencies first :

```
poetry install
```

and then run main application :

```
./run.sh
```
